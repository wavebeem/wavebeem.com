  Pokémon is one of the most important game franchises to me. I started playing
  Pokémon Blue on the original Game Boy as a kid, and as an adult I created
  Pokémon Type Calculator in 2013.

  <h2>Pokémon Type Calculator</h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.pkmn.help">Pokémon Type Calculator</a> (pkmn.help)
    is easily my magnum opus. It receives over
    <a href="https://plausible.io/pkmn.help">250 thousand visits per month</a>,
    and visitors usually spend around 4 minutes per session.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a personal project in 2013 when I was frustrated loading the
    ad-riddled <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net">Bulbapedia</a> on my
    budget Android smartphone is now considered a pillar of the Pokémon
    community. And I never spent a red cent on advertising it. It grew purely
    through search engine results and word of mouth.

  <h2>Pokémon Blue</h2>

  <p>
    The first Pokémon game I ever played: Pokémon Blue. I played it on the
    original
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> (DMG-01) unit.
    It took 4 AA batteries and the screen was barely visible unless under direct
    sunlight, but I was enamored. I definitely spent hundreds of hours playing
    the game.
  </p>

  <p>
    After beating the Elite Four countless times, catching most of the Pokédex,
    and getting my core party nearly to level 100, disaster struck. It had been
    so long since I had seen the beginning of the game, I decided to start a new
    game just to mess around. And in a brief moment of pure muscle memory, I
    saved my game, overwriting all of my hard earned progress. I was devastated.
    The whole ordeal left me bitter and uninterested in starting the next
    Pokémon game (Gold/Silver).
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't own and finish a new Pokémon game until Pokémon Platinum (2008) for
    the Nintendo DS. I have owned and played every main line Pokémon game since
    then. At some point I went back and played Pokémon Leaf Green, the Game Boy
    Advance remake of Pokémon Red/Blue.
  </p>

  <h2>Pokémon Crystal</h2>

  <p>
    I ordered the
    <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> in 2020,
    shortly after I had a surging interest in playing Game Boy games. I had just
    finished playing Dragon Quest I+II and Dragon Quest Monsters for the Game
    Boy Color, and I was thrilled to get my fancy new backlight USB-C GB/GBC/GBA
    compatible device. But it mostly sat in a drawer for a while.
  </p>

  <p>
    At some point my partner unearthed their old Game Boy cartridges. The save
    batteries had died, but knowing how to solder, it's not a tough fix. I
    stepped in and soldered new save batteries into the cartridges. Then a
    couple years later I got the urge to play their copy of Crystal. Despite not
    playing Gold/Silver/Crystal in their era, I was a huge Game Boy kid, so I'm
    enamored with the graphics so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    I haven't found many good sources of lossless screenshots of pixel art video
    games online, so I wanted to create a gallery of fun images from my
    playthrough.

      It's me, Sage. I think it's interesting that the text "ID No." has
      anti-aliasing, unlike all other text on screen.
