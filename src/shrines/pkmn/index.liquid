    <p>
      Pokémon is one of the most important game franchises to me. I started
      playing Pokémon Blue on the original Game Boy as a kid, and as an adult I
      created Pokémon Type Calculator in 2013.
    </p>

  <h2>Pokémon Type Calculator</h2>

  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.pkmn.help">Pokémon Type Calculator</a> (pkmn.help)
    is easily my magnum opus. It receives over
    <a href="https://plausible.io/pkmn.help">250 thousand visits per month</a>,
    and visitors usually spend around 4 minutes per session.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a personal project in 2013 when I was frustrated loading the
    ad-riddled
    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net">Bulbapedia</a> on my budget
    Android smartphone is now considered a pillar of the Pokémon community. And
    I never spent a red cent on advertising it. It grew purely through search
    engine results and word of mouth.

  <h2>Pokémon Blue</h2>

  <p>
    The first Pokémon game I ever played: Pokémon Blue. I played it on the
    original
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> (DMG-01) unit.
    It took 4 AA batteries and the screen was barely visible unless under direct
    sunlight, but I was enamored. I definitely spent hundreds of hours playing
    the game.
  </p>

  <p>
    After beating the Elite Four countless times, catching most of the Pokédex,
    and getting my core party nearly to level 100, disaster struck. It had been
    so long since I had seen the beginning of the game, I decided to start a new
    game just to mess around. And in a brief moment of pure muscle memory, I
    saved my game, overwriting all of my hard earned progress. I was devastated.
    The whole ordeal left me bitter and uninterested in starting the next
    Pokémon game (Gold/Silver).
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't own and finish a new Pokémon game until Pokémon Platinum (2008) for
    the Nintendo DS. I have owned and played every main line Pokémon game since
    then. At some point I went back and played Pokémon Leaf Green, the Game Boy
    Advance remake of Pokémon Red/Blue.
  </p>

  <h2>Pokémon Crystal</h2>

  <p>
    I ordered the
    <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> in 2020,
    shortly after I had a surging interest in playing Game Boy games. I had just
    finished playing Dragon Quest I+II and Dragon Quest Monsters for the Game
    Boy Color, and I was thrilled to get my fancy new backlight USB-C GB/GBC/GBA
    compatible device. But it mostly sat in a drawer for a while.
  </p>

  <p>
    At some point my partner unearthed their old Game Boy cartridges. The save
    batteries had died, but knowing how to solder, it's not a tough fix. I
    stepped in and soldered new save batteries into the cartridges. Then a
    couple years later I got the urge to play their copy of Crystal. Despite not
    playing Gold/Silver/Crystal in their era, I was a huge Game Boy kid, so I'm
    enamored with the graphics so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    I haven't found many good sources of lossless screenshots of pixel art video
    games online, so I wanted to create a gallery of fun images from my
    playthrough.

      I was pretty underleveled for the Elite Four, but by using
      <strong>strong</strong> Pokémon instead of my favorites, I was able to win
      without grinding. Sorry Karen, but I'm an adult with a job, I don't have
      time to win with my favorites.
    </figcaption>

  <figure>
    <img src="./img/win0.gbc.webp" alt="" />
    <figcaption>
      That's me! It took about 50 hours including some grinding I didn't really
      need to do. Plus I left the game idle a bit while playing in docked mode
      with my Analogue Pocket.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="./img/win1.gbc.webp" alt="" />
    <figcaption>
      I didn't really want to take any legendary/mythical Pokémon to the Elite
      Four, but I didn't feel like grinding and Suicune was already at a good
      level. So they were my backup Ice attack user for Alakazam, and I may have
      used a Water attack once?

      Golem has historically been fantastic on my team, but the Elite Four was
      better at hitting his weaknesses. He did help out, though.

    <img src="./img/win3.gbc.webp" alt="" />
    <figcaption>
      Alakazam is absurdly good in this game. Thunder Punch, Ice Punch, and
      Psychic made him an absolute monster.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="./img/win4.gbc.webp" alt="" />
    <figcaption>
      Gyarados! I feel like he was such a monster in some of the games I played,
      but I didn't have as much luck with him here. Loading him up first with
      Surf then with the inferior Waterfall, combined with his lackluster
      Special Attack, made him mediocre at using his STAB for Water attacks. He
      mostly just uses Strength and hits hard. But hey, cool free shiny
      Gyarados, right?
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>

    <figcaption>
      Dragonair! I got the free Dratini from the dragon master guy and then gave
      him the Exp. Share. I haven't actually used him in combat yet, but I'm
      excited to eventually get a Dragonite, I guess. But the slow growth rate
      is brutal.

      My starter, Typhlosion. Not as good as I hoped, honestly. He takes way too
      long to get any decent Fire moves. Putting Rollout on him was pretty great
      though, since he avoids the array of Rock type weaknesses and has the HP
      to stay alive long enough for Rollout to become a real threat.
    </figcaption>

      Whew! I did it. I beat the Elite Four. I've heard Kanto is mostly a cake
      walk after Johto, so I think I'll take the time to go through it.
