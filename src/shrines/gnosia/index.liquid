<h2>Please Play Gnosia</h2>

<p>
  Gnosia is such a special game to me. The two most important characters (Setsu
  and Raqio) are both nonbinary, and the player character can be too. I played
  this game before I came out as nonbinary, and my repressed feelings
  intertwined with the fabulous art, music, and narrative to form a magical
  experience.
