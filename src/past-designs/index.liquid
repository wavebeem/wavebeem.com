  <h2>I'm notorious for redesigning my website</h2>

  <p>
    Rather than be ashamed of this tendency, I'm trying to embrace it. Welcome
    to my gallery of page designs. I hope you enjoy looking at them as much as I
    made them.

  <h2>2025</h2>

    I'm embracing content and organization. I tried to make the single column
    layout work on desktop, but it was really struggling. I have too many pages
    to put in a plain list, so I'm attempting to use hierarchy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group names aren't very good right now, but the idea of breaking up the
    links into groups of five or less items helps keep it from feeling
    overwhelming.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously you had to scroll to the bottom of any given page to start
    navigating to other content, which felt kinda weird. I'm embracing
    battled-tested design here: a sidebar on desktop and a hamburger menu on
    mobile. I specifically opted to not make the sidebar docked in part because
    it's more challenging, and in part to reduce distractions while reading
    longer posts. And the hamburger menu on mobile just expands content in
    place, rather than being a modal interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bright, saturated colors weren't helping me achieve the "printed paper"
    look I had in my mind. I darkened and desaturated things a bit, giving
    everything a calmer look. I also now dynamically switch between the
    <code>multiply</code> and <code>screen</code> blend modes based on
    light/dark mode, rather than using <code>luminosity.</code>

  <p>
    I was tired of using shapes and colors like a cudgel. I have been wanting to
    make a modern two color design for a long time. Going from over a dozen
    colors to just two makes it a lot easier to make page-specific themes, like
    for my new shrines.
  </p>

  <h2>2024</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"

    />
    <figcaption>Fresh green (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Slime mode was super fun, but I was just tired of not having enough green on
    the page. This design was inspired by the Sprite Vanilla Frost soda can
    design.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2024e.webp"

      height="4664"
    />
    <figcaption>Slime mode (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This was the final form of slime mode, my attempt at making my website feel
    more fun. I still really like how this theme looks, but it's just not
    <em>green</em> enough for me.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2024d.webp"

    />
    <figcaption>Summer style (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This design coincided with my 24/7 use of Night Mode. The warmer screen tone
    feels quite comfortable on my eyes in comparison to the harsh blues I was
    used to.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2024c.webp"

    />
    <figcaption>Lime &amp; lavender (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Inspired by fancy gelato pictures, I wanted to make something soft and airy.
    My previous design had many lines and sections, so I wanted to simplify
    things.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2024b.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1290"
    />
    <figcaption>Aero (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The love child of Windows Aero, the Wii, and stripes! This design is really
    fun, but the white felt overbearing, especially on mobile. There wasn't much
    interest besides the background, which bothered me. I'm still proud of the
    fade out half boxes I came up with for adding texture to the page.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2024a.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1389"
    />
    <figcaption>Candy green (2024)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Maximal boxes. Boxes inside of boxes. Wild textures. Gradients providing
    depth. A gorgeous color scheme inspired by one of my favorite Destiny 2
    shaders. This was super fun, and a great showcase for my candy.css library.
  </p>

  <h2>2023</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2023.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1396"
    />
    <figcaption>Cyber purple &amp; lime (2023)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I needed a new theme to match my brand new neon green hair. I still like
    this one a lot. I wish it had more gree, but the purple is
    <em>very</em> nice and the neon green really <strong>pops</strong> against
    it.
  </p>

  <h2>2022</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2022.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1369"
    />
    <figcaption>Green &amp; pink (2022)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Ugh, this looked a lot better in dark mode. The light mode green background
    is so pale and sickly. It looked quite good in dark mode where I could use a
    richer green. I think this theme is a perfect example of how you need to be
    creative when switching between dark and light themes, unless you only use
    neutral colors.
  </p>

  <h2>2021</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2021.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="804"
    />
    <figcaption>1bit-ui (2021)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Technically using 1bit-ui, I added lots of extra colors to this page. The
    fancy cards look cool, especially alongside the pixel art portrait I made,
    but it's an idea that was only half heartedly implemented.
  </p>

  <h2>2020</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2020.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="800"
    />
    <figcaption>Pixel art (2020)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This design still looks really cool to me, though the amount of green is
    basically zero! This was my first design to include a dark mode, which I
    thought looked really nice. I waited 5 years to use a serif font again, lol.
  </p>

  <h2>2018</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2018.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1166"
    />
    <figcaption>Big art (2018)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I got this cute art commissioned from a friend for my business card. I liked
    it so much I put it on my website. I think it was a bit too large on the
    page though.
  </p>

  <h2>2017</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2017.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1054"
    />
    <figcaption>Chat bubble (2017)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Wow, this sure was white. I copied the Material Design SCREAMING LABELS
    trend (ew, yuck, this was so awful). I unnecessarily made the nav bar look
    like tabs including active state (I was proud of this, though). I like the
    fun background color on the links, and my pixel art self portrait.
  </p>

  <h2>2016</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2016.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="917"
    />
    <figcaption>Bussiness card (2016)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Not much to see here. It was more of a digital business card. The design
    looked good on mobile but awkward on desktop.
  </p>

  <h2>2015</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2015.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1437"
    />
    <figcaption>Cards (2015)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Ten years later I can really see how I've grown with respect to typography
    and layout design. This is kind of a mess, though it's information dense and
    easy to understand, I think.
  </p>

  <h2>2014</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2014.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1437"
    />
    <figcaption>Super thin font (2014)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I do not miss the days of pencil thin fonts that are totally unreadable.
    Apparently I thought to use one here. The bold and low contrast links kinda
    bother me. Underlines aren't scary, but I think a lot of people (including
    me) thought they were back then.
  </p>

  <h2>2013</h2>

  <figure>
    <img
      loading="lazy"
      src="./img/site2013.webp"
      alt=""
      width="1280"
      height="1230"
    />
    <figcaption>The original (2013)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Despite also having a resume linked in PDF format, this is basically just an
    HTML resume. It's quite boring, but it's pretty effective. Using the accent
    color for both links and headings is really confusing, but I can tell I was
    trying to zhuzh up the main page a bit. Also, jump scare seeing the ghostly
    "Projects" text that's basically zero contrast lol. The extremely dense text
    probably felt better on smaller screens of the era, but hey, I tried!
