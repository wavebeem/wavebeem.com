<p>
  My name is Sage (they/them), but you may also know me as wavebeem. I've been a
  professional software developer since 2012. I've loved video games my whole
  life. I live with my wonderful partner,
  <a href="https://ash.fish/">Ash</a>, in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">Portland</a>.

<h2>Computers</h2>

<p>
  I fell in love with computers thanks to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Plus!">Microsoft Plus!</a>,
  an incredible customization pack for Windows 95 that helped you theme your
  computer down to the smallest detail. Message boards and the world wide wibe
  were a haven for a weirdo like me.
</p>

<p>
  I learned how to program in high school, and I've been doing it constantly
  ever since. After getting my degree in computer science, I've been working
  nonstop with web technologies. I love HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>Video games</h2>

<p>
  As a little baby, my grandma held me on her lap while playing Dr. Mario on the
  NES. Is it any surprise that a few decades later I'm still obsessed with video
  games?
</p>

<p>
  My biggest love is handheld games, particularly the Nintendo Game Boy systems
  and the original Nintendo DS. I love 2D pixel art, and I make it myself from
  time to time. Check out my <a href="/shrines/">shrines</a> for spaces
  dedicated to games I love.

<h2>Other interests</h2>

<p>
  I've been a huge fan of metal music since I was a teen. My favorite subgenre
  is progressive metal. I also listen to a lot of video game music, and have
  been dabbling more in electronic music recently. My favorite electronic artist
  is
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_(band)">Justice</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I love wearing makeup, especially bold and unusual looks. I sometimes make
  pixel <a href="/art/">art</a>. I adore cats, and as a kid my favorite animal
  was the frog.
</p>

<p>I'm an official representative for the color green.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>
  My full name is <i>Sage Fennel Mock</i>. My pronouns are
  <i>they/them/theirs</i>. I have mixed feelings about my last name, so I also
  sometimes go by <i>Sage Fennel</i> or <i>Sage F.M.</i>.
</p>

<p>
  My legal name is available for employers and other parties on an as-needed
  basis.
</p>

<h2>Preferred terms</h2>

<p>
  I do not use honorifics such as Mr, Ms, or Mx. I tend to prefer gender neutral
  terms. Otherwise be creative, or use a feminine term. For example, I would
  prefer <q>Queen Sage</q> to <q>King Sage</q>, but <q>Your Highness</q>
  is better.
