  Review: Playdate Season 2
description: >-
  A stationary shmup, an ancient aliens archaeology game, a supremely silly
  point and click adventure, and a game about become an extraordinarily long dog
  with extraordinarliy big poops, and more...

## Overview

[12 games for $39](https://play.date/games/seasons/two/).

## Dig Dig Dino!

A simple game with some minor UX problems that hold it back from perfection.

## Fulcrum Defender

A relaxing shmup. I need to revisit this with the new difficulty options.

## Long Puppy

A super weird game that makes good use of the crank. Like Katamari, this game is
more fun with time limits turned off.

## Chance's Lucky Escape

Maybe the easiest point and click adventure game I've played, but the pacing and
writing is great. I had a lot of fun with this one. I played it almost nonstop
until completion.
