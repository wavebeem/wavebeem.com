It would've been nice to know about the concept of "vector projection" back
in 2019. Instead, I fumbled my way through inventing something similar to it in
order to solve a seemingly simple math problem that plagued me and three other
developers for over a day at work.

I originally created this in 2019 for a graph editor project I was working on.
