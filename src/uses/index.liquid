<h2>Keyboards</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Helix split keyboard (64 keys)</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I use a
    <a href="https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix">Helix keyboard</a>
    that I built myself using a kit from
    <a href="https://www.littlekeyboards.com/"> Little Keyboards</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The split form factor makes a notable difference in shoulder tension based
    on my arm placement and the stress accumulated through the day. Technically
    I use a 50% Helix (including the number row), but I learned how to type on
    40% keyboards (no number row) already, so I mostly use the numbers as gaming
    shortcuts rather than for typing numbers or symbols.
  </p>

  <p>
    The board is hot swap and I'm currently using
    <a
      href="https://thekey.company/products/tangerine-switches?variant=40072888025177"
    >
      Tangerine switches
    </a>
    (62g) from TheKey.Company. I'm a huge fan of linear switches for both gaming
    and typing. I like a medium weight, around 62g seems to be ideal :)
  </p>

  <p>
    For keycaps I have the long awaited DSA KeroKeroKeys, which are extremely
    green and frog themed. The frog-child within me is thrilled, and my
    green-loving side is quite happy as well. I only use DSA profile keycaps
    because I think they're both more comfortable to type on and easier to use
    effectively on a keyboard with such a weird layout.

<h2>Mice</h2>

<details>

    <i>Lamzu Atlantis OG V2 Pro</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I'm a total freak about mice. I love buying and trying mice. The first
    gaming mouse I loved was the Logitech MX518, and it's a far cry from what I
    go for these days. I think my grip style would be classified as "relaxed
    claw grip", because I don't like scrunching up my index/middle fingers super
    hard near the top of the mouse, but I also don't put a lot of my upper palm
    on the mouse. I usually touch the mouse with the right side of my upper
    palm. I like when the rear of the mouse fits snugly into the base of my
    palm. I refuse to click the mouse wheel with my finger tip, opting for
    hitting it with the pad of my index finger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyways, so right now I'm alternating between the
    <a href="https://lamzu.com/products/lamzu-atlantis-og-v2-pro-gaming-mouse">
      Lamzu Atlantis OG V2 PRO
    </a>
    in matcha green and the
    <a
      href="https://www.pulsar.gg/products/x2h-gaming-mouse?_pos=2&_sid=f0fdbd7b9&_ss=r&variant=44194583576830"
    >
      Pulsar X2H
    </a>
    in white.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both mice have substantial rear-ends that my lower palm can grip
    comfortably. The Atlantis has amazing angled side walls that make lifting
    the mouse extremely easy. Though the Atlantis has an inferior coating, being
    somewhat slippery when the mouse is cold. The scroll wheel click is nicer on
    the Atlantis (softer), but the X2H has better scroll wheel step definition.
    The X2H has the largest rump of any mouse I've used, which really forces you
    into a nice claw grip. It freaked me out so bad that I almost returned the
    mouse initially, but it's grown on me a lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find it really hard to decide which to keep using, and unfortunately I go
    back and forth between mice a lot...
  </p>

  <p>
    Honorable mention to the
    <a href="https://lamzu.com/products/lamzu-thorn-gaming-mouse">
      Lamzu Thorn</a
    >, the
    <a href="https://www.pulsar.gg/products/x2?variant=44194567323902">
      Pulsar X2V1</a
    >, and the
    <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-viper-v3-pro">
      Razer Viper V3 Pro</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Thorn is the best ergonomic mouse I've used, but the extremely round
    shape and strange coating can make it a little unwieldy when the mouse is
    cold. It actually grips really nicely when it warms up, which is weird to
    say! Also it's using Razer's optical switches which don't feel very good and
    sound extremely loud in this mouse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The X2V1 is the mouse that made me realize how fun a relaxed claw grip can
    feel. I don't have especially large hands, but gaming mice have been
    trending down in size for a while now. It's great to have lighter weight
    mice, but I feel like palm grip has suffered because of this. This was my
    first ultra lightweight mouse, and my first wireless gaming mouse, and I'm a
    total convert to both now. Mouse tech has advanced so much in the past 5
    years or so.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Viper V3 Pro has a pretty inoffensive shape that's good at many styles
    while being great at none, in my opinion. But I love Razer's signature "deep
    dish" indendentations that lock in your grip at a comfortable wide set
    angle, and the coating is nice.

<h2>Displays</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Dell Alienware AW2523HF 24.5" 1920&times;1080 360 Hz</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    My main display is the
    <a
      href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-25-gaming-monitor-aw2523hf/apd/210-bfed/monitors-monitor-accessories"
    >
      Dell Alienware AW2523HF</a
    >. It's a 24.5" 1920&times;1080 360 Hz display. The 360 Hz is overkill for
    me, I just wanted a good 1080p 24" display that supported HDMI 2.0 so that I
    could use high refresh rate on both my gaming PC (DisplayPort) and my work
    laptop (HDMI).
  </p>

  <p>
    I previously used a 27" 2560&times;1440 144 Hz display for about 8 years,
    but I realized that the increased pixel density made everything harder to
    read, and the size/resolution meant that maximizing any window felt absurdly
    huge, but splitting in halves felt too small.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a nerd about refresh rates and that previous monitor was a G-SYNC
    compatible display I bought as an early adopter of the tech. The difference
    between 60 Hz and 120 Hz is night and day, not just for gaming but even
    basic stuff like scrolling looks so good. I've noticed a difference at 360
    Hz for moving my mouse cursor, but I haven't played any games that can take
    advantage of it yet. I should boot up DOOM (2016) at some point and try out
    the different refresh rates...

    I also have an ancient (2013) screen in portrait mode to the left of my main
    monitor. I only use this to house Discord and video game guides while I play
    games on my other monitor. I do not multitask with it. It makes my neck hurt
    staring to the side, so I try to minimize it.

<h2>Audio</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Koss KPH40 on-ear headphones</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I use the
    <a href="https://koss.com/products/kph40-utility">Koss KPH40</a>
    as my all day headphone for video calls, music, and gaming. I have modded
    them with the
    <a href="https://www.yaxi.jp/onlineshop/">Yaxi Porta Pro earpads</a>, and a
    3.5mm audio cable extension.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are lighter than a feather, never fall off, barely put any pressure on
    my head, look nice, are durable, and sound pretty good! And that's all for
    $40 USD on Amazon if you're lucky enough to get them on sale. The
    replacement pads were $10 USD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given that they're on-ear headphones, I can hear myself perfectly for work
    calls or voice chat while gaming. They sound incredible for music! Maybe for
    gaming you could want a bit of high end for clarity, but they're very easy
    listening. My only audio complaint is that certain deeper frequencies when
    speaking can cause a strange rattle in the driver that's distracting. I
    never notice it in music though.

  <p>
    I honestly haven't used speakers with my PC in years, but I do have a decent
    budget stereo setup for the TV downstairs: the Sony STRDH190 2-ch receiver
    and two floor-standing speakers. We don't even have a subwoofer any more
    because honestly I'm satisfied with the level of bass from what I have.

<h2>Computers</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>NZXT Player 3 (2023)</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    A high end prebuilt gaming PC. I used to build my own PCs, but these days
    it's not that much more money to get a good prebuilt, and it saves a lot of
    time and headache if parts arrive dead&mdash;or worse&mdash;crash your PC
    randomly.

  <summary>
    <i>Apple MacBook Pro M1 16" (2021)</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    This is my work computer. It's got a ton of computing power and incredible
    battery life. I don't really like macOS, but other than that it's nice.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Apple MacBook Pro 13" (2015)</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    This is my personal laptop. It's so old Apple doesn't release macOS for it
    any more. It's currently running Fedora, but I almost never use it since my
    work computer is always charged and ready to go.
  </p>
</details>

<h2>Software</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Visual Studio Code</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was an early adopter of VS Code, back when Atom was extremely popular.
    Atom's slow performance and constantly breaking plugin system made me eager
    to leave it. Before that I had used Sublime Text, which is the gold standard
    for fast editors in my experience. My main problem was the janky plugin
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before all of that I used vim for like 8 years, but I left it behind the
    moment I saw multi-cursor editing in Sublime Text. I'm happy to be living in
    the modern era now lol.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Firefox</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Ever since Firefox showed up and introduced tabs and fast web browsing, I've
    been a huge fan. There was a while where Firefox was notably slower than
    Chrome, and I jumped ship. After they fixed performance issues I came back.
    I love that they're privacy focused and really care about users in a way
    that Google never will.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Discord</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was an early adopter of Discord, just a few months after it was released.
    Even back then, it was obvious that using Slack for non-work chats was not a
    good idea. And for voice chat across games, my gaming clan was using...
    Ventrilo, or "Vent" as everyone called it. Vent had (has?) some awful
    Windows 95-ish interface, though it did technically get the job done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discord is a lot less cool now that it's ubiquitous and desperately trying
    to squeeze money out of its audience, but it still seems like a relatively
    unchallenged tool for doing online gaming with folks.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also ends up being a de-facto global direct message app since so many
    people have it, even if they're not gamers. Plus, the emojis are super fun.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>LINE</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I started using this because of some friends who use it. Honestly I kinda
    hate it, but it's cool that it has end-to-end encryption (though it's not
    open source). I love the sticker packs and privacy, but very few people have
    it, and it's kind of horrible on desktop.
  </p>

  <summary>
    <i>1Password</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was thrilled when 1Password went cross platform, finally letting me ditch
    LastPass's awful user interface. I know some people are upset with
    1Password's rewrite as a universal app using web tech rather than
    maintaining separate desktop apps for each platform, but I think they've
    done a good job making it feel relatively native and snappy.

  <summary>
    <i>Musicbee & Doppler</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Honestly I don't really love either of these, but I need to use them. I'm a
    sicko about buying and owning actual music files (like the times of old!
    remember the iPod?). Sadly, music apps aren't very popular any more with
    music streaming dominating the landscape. Musicbee for Windows is obtuse but
    works well. Doppler for Mac is pretty polished, and the only music player
    for Mac I currently like.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a few requirements for music apps: gapless playback, and the ability
    to browser albums by album artist. It doesn't sound like much, but many
    players fail to have both of those features. It seems a lot of players are
    very "playlist" and "file system" focused. I usually just queue up a few
    albums I like, rather than curating songs for a playlist I will use again.

  <p>
    I love Bandcamp, but they don't usually have
    <q>big label</q>
    music. I used to use iTunes or Amazon to purchase DRM free files for those,
    but their UIs are increasingly shoving
    <q>music streaming</q>
    down our throats. I recently discovered Qobuz, which seems to do a good job
    of just letting you buy DRM free music files in peace.

  <p>
    Extremely cute, snappy, and functional app for making pixel art. It's so
    fast and easy that I actually use it for general image editing too, as long
    as the files aren't too large. I also have Affinity Designer and Affinity
    Photo, but I rarely use either of them.
