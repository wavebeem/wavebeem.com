  <summary>
    <i>Keychron Q11 &ndash; 75% split mechanical keyboard</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I use a
    <a
      href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard"
      >Keychron Q11</a
    >
    split mechanical keyboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    The split form factor makes a notable difference in shoulder tension based
    on my arm placement and the stress accumulated through the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The board is hot swap and I'm currently using
    <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/kailh-box-v2-switch-set">
      Kailh Box V2 Red
    </a>
    (40g) switches from Keychron. I'm a huge fan of linear switches for both
    gaming and typing. The light weight is comfortable and doesn't fatigue me
    after a long day.
  </p>

  <p>
    For keycaps I have the long awaited DSA KeroKeroKeys, which are extremely
    green and frog themed. The frog-child within me is thrilled, and my
    green-loving side is quite happy as well. I only use DSA profile keycaps
    because I think they're both more comfortable to type on and easier to use
    effectively on a keyboard with such a weird layout.

    <i>VAXEE XE v2 Wireless &ndash; gaming mouse</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I'm a total freak about mice. I love buying and trying mice. The first
    gaming mouse I loved was the Logitech MX518, and it's a far cry from what I
    go for these days. I think my grip style would be classified as "relaxed
    claw grip", because I don't like scrunching up my index/middle fingers super
    hard near the top of the mouse, but I also don't put a lot of my upper palm
    on the mouse. I usually touch the mouse with the right side of my upper
    palm. I like when the rear of the mouse fits snugly into the base of my
    palm. I refuse to click the mouse wheel with my finger tip, opting for
    hitting it with the pad of my index finger.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find it really hard to decide which to keep using, and unfortunately I go
    back and forth between mice a lot... I don't think this is the #1 most comfortable mouse I've used, but it's close, and I love that it comes in green.
  </p>

    <i>ASUS ROG Strix (XG27UCG) &ndash; 27" 4K &commat; 120 Hz monitor</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    My main display is the
    <a
      href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-25-gaming-monitor-aw2523hf/apd/210-bfed/monitors-monitor-accessories"
    >
      Dell Alienware AW2523HF</a
    >. It's a 24.5" 1920&times;1080 360 Hz display. The 360 Hz is overkill for
    me, I just wanted a good 1080p 24" display that supported HDMI 2.0 so that I
    could use high refresh rate on both my gaming PC (DisplayPort) and my work
    laptop (HDMI).
  </p>

  <p>
    I previously used a 27" 2560&times;1440 144 Hz display for about 8 years,
    but I realized that the increased pixel density made everything harder to
    read, and the size/resolution meant that maximizing any window felt absurdly
    huge, but splitting in halves felt too small.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a nerd about refresh rates and that previous monitor was a G-SYNC
    compatible display I bought as an early adopter of the tech. The difference
    between 60 Hz and 120 Hz is night and day, not just for gaming but even
    basic stuff like scrolling looks so good. I've noticed a difference at 360
    Hz for moving my mouse cursor, but I haven't played any games that can take
    advantage of it yet. I should boot up DOOM (2016) at some point and try out
    the different refresh rates...

    <i>Koss KPH40 &ndash; headphones (on-ear)</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I use the
    <a href="https://koss.com/products/kph40-utility">Koss KPH40</a>
    as my all day headphone for video calls, music, and gaming. I have modded
    them with the
    <a href="https://www.yaxi.jp/onlineshop/">Yaxi Porta Pro earpads</a>, and a
    3.5mm audio cable extension.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are lighter than a feather, never fall off, barely put any pressure on
    my head, look nice, are durable, and sound pretty good! And that's all for
    $40 USD on Amazon if you're lucky enough to get them on sale. The
    replacement pads were $10 USD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given that they're on-ear headphones, I can hear myself perfectly for work
    calls or voice chat while gaming. They sound incredible for music! Maybe for
    gaming you could want a bit of high end for clarity, but they're very easy
    listening. My only audio complaint is that certain deeper frequencies when
    speaking can cause a strange rattle in the driver that's distracting. I
    never notice it in music though.

    <i>NZXT Player 3 (2023) &ndash; gaming PC</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    A high end prebuilt gaming PC. I used to build my own PCs, but these days
    it's not that much more money to get a good prebuilt, and it saves a lot of
    time and headache if parts arrive dead&mdash;or worse&mdash;crash your PC
    randomly.

<h2>Software</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Visual Studio Code</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was an early adopter of VS Code, back when Atom was extremely popular.
    Atom's slow performance and constantly breaking plugin system made me eager
    to leave it. Before that I had used Sublime Text, which is the gold standard
    for fast editors in my experience. My main problem was the janky plugin
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before all of that I used vim for like 8 years, but I left it behind the
    moment I saw multi-cursor editing in Sublime Text. I'm happy to be living in
    the modern era now lol.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>Firefox</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Ever since Firefox showed up and introduced tabs and fast web browsing, I've
    been a huge fan. There was a while where Firefox was notably slower than
    Chrome, and I jumped ship. After they fixed performance issues I came back.
    I love that they're privacy focused and really care about users in a way
    that Google never will.
  </p>

  <summary>
    <i>Discord</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was an early adopter of Discord, just a few months after it was released.
    Even back then, it was obvious that using Slack for non-work chats was not a
    good idea. And for voice chat across games, my gaming clan was using...
    Ventrilo, or "Vent" as everyone called it. Vent had (has?) some awful
    Windows 95-ish interface, though it did technically get the job done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discord is a lot less cool now that it's ubiquitous and desperately trying
    to squeeze money out of its audience, but it still seems like a relatively
    unchallenged tool for doing online gaming with folks.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also ends up being a de-facto global direct message app since so many
    people have it, even if they're not gamers. Plus, the emojis are super fun.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>LINE</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I started using this because of some friends who use it. Honestly I kinda
    hate it, but it's cool that it has end-to-end encryption (though it's not
    open source). I love the sticker packs and privacy, but very few people have
    it, and it's kind of horrible on desktop.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>1Password</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I was thrilled when 1Password went cross platform, finally letting me ditch
    LastPass's awful user interface. I know some people are upset with
    1Password's rewrite as a universal app using web tech rather than
    maintaining separate desktop apps for each platform, but I think they've
    done a good job making it feel relatively native and snappy.

  <summary>
    <i>Musicbee & Doppler</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Honestly I don't really love either of these, but I need to use them. I'm a
    sicko about buying and owning actual music files (like the times of old!
    remember the iPod?). Sadly, music apps aren't very popular any more with
    music streaming dominating the landscape. Musicbee for Windows is obtuse but
    works well. Doppler for Mac is pretty polished, and the only music player
    for Mac I currently like.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a few requirements for music apps: gapless playback, and the ability
    to browser albums by album artist. It doesn't sound like much, but many
    players fail to have both of those features. It seems a lot of players are
    very "playlist" and "file system" focused. I usually just queue up a few
    albums I like, rather than curating songs for a playlist I will use again.

    <i>Qobuz &amp; Bandcamp</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    I love Bandcamp, but they don't usually have
    <q>big label</q>
    music. I used to use iTunes or Amazon to purchase DRM free files for those,
    but their UIs are increasingly shoving
    <q>music streaming</q>
    down our throats. I recently discovered Qobuz, which seems to do a good job
    of just letting you buy DRM free music files in peace.

    <i>Aseprite</i>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Extremely cute, snappy, and functional app for making pixel art. It's so
    fast and easy that I actually use it for general image editing too, as long
    as the files aren't too large. I also have Affinity Designer and Affinity
    Photo, but I rarely use either of them.
