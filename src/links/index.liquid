  <h2>Uncategorized</h2>

  <p>Links are in alphabetical order. Remind me to organize them later.</p>

  <ul>
    {% for link in coolLinks.allLinks %}
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="{{ link.url }}">{{ link.title }}</a>

  <h2>Embed my site button</h2>

  <p>
    I don't really like having a site button, but I made one anyway for all the
    folks who liking collecting them for their button walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're welcome to use this image, but I might update it frequently, or my
    website's design may not reflect how this button looks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're allowed to hotlink the image if you'd like, the bandwidth really
    isn't expensive.
