## What is code generation?

Compilers and interpreters are basically big pipelines, transforming one type of
data to into another, and finally either generating code or running a program.

At a very high level, the steps are:

- üìö Read the source code
- üå≤ Parse the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è _(optional)_ Emit warnings based on the AST
- üîç _(optional)_ Typecheck the AST
- üíª Generate code or run the program

Technically the AST step is optional (PHP only recently started using an AST),
but basically every language implementation uses this step.

Code generation is the final step in a compiler. The compiler generates code
that produces the desired effect. Generated code might be JavaScript
(compile-to-JS language), machine code (C compiler), JVM bytecode (Java
compiler, Clojure compiler, etc).

## Code generation vs interpretation

My [previous blog post][1] about making a programming language covers making an
interpreter. Interpreters are easy to make because all you have to do is write a
program that has the right behavior, whereas with a compiler, you have to
generate code in another language that happens to have the same behavior as your
source language.

This means that the more different your input and output languages are, the
harder it is to do the code generation. [CoffeeScript][2] is extremely similar
to JavaScript, so it is able to produce a similar amount of JavaScript as
CoffeeScript to achive its code generation. [PureScript][3] requires a _lot_
more JavaScript code output to achieve the correct program, because it is a lot
more different than JavaScript.

Compiling to JavaScript is a bit of a unique case though, compared to compiling
to machine code or some kind of bytecode. JavaScript is actually intended as a
language for programmers to program in, unlike, say, JVM bytecode. So JavaScript
environments expect you to debug and inspect JavaScript code. Nobody really
cares if the JVM bytecode from a compiler looks _weird_, but if you generate
really weird looking code from a language that compiles to JavaScript, it can
bother people when they're debugging. [Source maps][4] can help with that
problem, but it's only a partial debugging solution.

## An example pipeline from start to finish

In the interest of time, I'll just be going over a high level view of the steps
in transforming a simple language with just basic math through the entire
compiler process, but ommitting any code.

## Step 0: The input

This is just the text that would be in a code text file. Let's call it
CoolScript‚Ñ¢.

```js
let x = 1
let y = 2
print x + y ^ 3
```

## Step 1: Tokenization

This is the output from the tokenization substep of parsing. Note that not all
parsing techniques have a tokenization step.

```js
[
  // line 1
  { type: "Let", value: "let" },
  { type: "Var", value: "x" },
  { type: "Eq", value: "=" },
  { type: "Number", value: "1" },
  { type: "Newline", value: "\n" },

  // line 2
  { type: "Let", value: "let" },
  { type: "Var", value: "y" },
  { type: "Eq", value: "=" },
  { type: "Number", value: "2" },
  { type: "Newline", value: "\n" },

  // line 3
  { type: "Print", value: "print" },
  { type: "Var", value: "x" },
  { type: "Op", value: "+" },
  { type: "Var", value: "y" },
  { type: "Op", value: "^" },
  { type: "Number", value: "3" },
];
```

## Step 2: Parsing

This is the step where either the source code or source tokens are converted
into JSON data that can be easily processed by the rest of the compiler.
Importantly, this takes a linear sequence of data (either text or tokens), and
turns it into deep, nested data.

```js
{ type: 'Program',
  statements:
   [ { type: 'cool.Let',
       name: 'x',
       value: { type: 'cool.Number', value: 1 } },
     { type: 'cool.Let',
       name: 'y',
       value: { type: 'cool.Number', value: 2 } },
     { type: 'cool.Print',
       value:
        { type: 'cool.Add',
          left: { type: 'cool.Var', name: 'x' },
          right:
           { type: 'cool.Pow',
             left: { type: 'cool.Var', name: 'y' },
             right: { type: 'cool.Number', value: 3 } } } } ] }
```

## Step 3: Translating to JS

This step is translating from the source language AST (CoolScript) to the
destination language AST (JavaScript). This is definitely the hardest part of
the compiler.

```js
{ type: 'Program',
  body:
   [ { type: 'VariableDeclaration',
       declarations:
        [ { type: 'VariableDeclarator',
            id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' },
            init: { type: 'Literal', value: 1, raw: '1' } } ],
       kind: 'var' },
     { type: 'VariableDeclaration',
       declarations:
        [ { type: 'VariableDeclarator',
            id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'y' },
            init: { type: 'Literal', value: 2, raw: '2' } } ],
       kind: 'var' },
     { type: 'ExpressionStatement',
       expression:
        { type: 'CallExpression',
          callee:
           { type: 'MemberExpression',
             computed: false,
             object: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'console' },
             property: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'log' } },
          arguments:
           [ { type: 'BinaryExpression',
               operator: '+',
               left: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' },
               right:
                { type: 'CallExpression',
                  callee:
                   { type: 'MemberExpression',
                     computed: false,
                     object: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'Math' },
                     property: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'pow' } },
                  arguments:
                   [ { type: 'Identifier', name: 'y' },
                     { type: 'Literal', value: 3, raw: '3' } ] } } ] } } ],
  sourceType: 'script' }
```

## Step 4: Code generation

For code generation the JS AST is turned into JS source code. Given the immense
object from step 3, [escodegen][4] can be used to get this next step essentially
for free.

```js
var x = 1;
var y = 2;
console.log(x + Math.pow(y, 3));
```

## Wrapping up

For now, actually coding the pipeline for the demonstration above will be left
as an exercise for the reader. I can suggest using [Parsimmon][5] as per my last
blog post. The AST translation will require your own hard work, but escodegen
can be used to turn the JS AST into JS code with ease.
