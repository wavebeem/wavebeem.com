## Prologue

I've been using React hooks since their public release roughly 3 years ago, and
I was incredibly excited for them. I still think hooks are great, but `useState`
in particular is hard to use correctly.

I will cover the issues I see repeatedly, why they're so confusing, and some
possible remedies.

**Note:** This post assumes familiarity with
[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and
[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## How state works

Consider this React component which increments a number on button click:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [num, setNum] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>num = {String(num)}</p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          setNum(num + 1);
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It's easy to forget that this `App` function is not called just once, but _every
time the component needs to re-render_. Functions don't store state between
multiple calls, so React actually stores this state. React _remembers_ this
component "instance" and stores its state internally. Every time the component
re-renders, React sends the correct state back when you call `useState`.

It's a bit weird, and it only gets weirder as your app grows in complexity.
Let's add some async code:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [num, setNum] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>num = {String(num)}</p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          //---------------------------------------------------------
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("async:", num);
          });
          setNum(num + 1);
          console.log("immediate:", num);
          //---------------------------------------------------------
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Both the "immediate" and the "async" value are always 1 behind the value
displayed in the UI. This is the result of
[variable closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures),
an often surprising feature to developers.

`num` is a `const` variable, meaning it can never be reassigned. But the value
gets "updated"! Every time `App` is called, React returns a new value from
`useState`. The `onClick` handler was created by a previous call to `App`, so
its closure is attached to an older `num` variable.

## A workaround with useRef

The problem is circumvented by using objects and mutation. `useRef` allows you
to do this, but there are some caveats.

```jsx
function useUpdate() {
  const [, update] = useReducer((state) => !state, false);
  return update;
}

function App() {
  const numRef = useRef(0);
  const update = useUpdate();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>num = {String(numRef.current)}</p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          //---------------------------------------------------------
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("async:", numRef.current);
          });
          numRef.current++;
          console.log("immediate:", numRef.current);
          update();
          //---------------------------------------------------------
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you need the old value, you can store it in a variable.

```js
const oldNum = numRef.current;
numRef.current++;
// Logs "1 --> 2"
console.log(oldNum, "-->", numRef.current);
```

Hooks like `useEffect` rely on object equality (`===`), so you might have issues
with effects not running since new objects are not created.

## An alternative: useMagicState

Let's imagine a new hook called `useMagicState`:

```jsx
//---------------------------------------------------------
function App() {
  const state = useMagicState({ num: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handler() {
      console.log("page click:", state.num);
    }
    setTimeout(handler, 500);
  }, [state.num]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>num = {String(state.num)}</p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          state.num++;
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
//---------------------------------------------------------

function createProxy(object, update) {
  return new Proxy(object, {
    set(target, property, value, receiver) {
      const oldValue = Reflect.get(target, property, receiver);
      if (!Object.is(value, oldValue)) {
        const ok = Reflect.set(target, property, value, receiver);
        // Automatically re-render after updating object values
        update();
        return ok;
      }
    },
  });
}

function useMagicState(state) {
  // Fake state used to trigger renders
  const [bit, update] = useReducer((state) => !state, false);

  // Store a copy of the state in a ref
  const stateRef = useRef({ ...state });

  // Create new proxies to the stateRef's data on update
  // so that memoized components still work correctly
  const [proxy, setProxy] = useState(() =>
    createProxy(stateRef.current, update),
  );
  useEffect(() => {
    setProxy(createProxy(stateRef.current, update));
  }, [bit]);

  return proxy;
}
```

Using `useMagicState` you can treat the returned object like a regular object,
except the assigning any of its properties will trigger a re-render. Because
`state` proxies to a single object, `state.property` will always refer to the
latest value of `property`. If you need to keep old values, use
`const oldState = { ...state }` to make a shallow copy. Variable closure still
happens, but the proxy always points to the latest values.

This API is called
[reactivity in Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html#what-is-reactivity).
It was inspired by hooks, and it may be time for React to take inspiration from
Vue.

## Why does it work this way?

I would love to hear _why_ the React core team created `useState` with this
pitfall. Even if you understand variable closure, it's frequently quite
inconvenient to deal with in React.

I swear I've seen some discussion of this on Twitter, but my search for written
answers has failed me.

My theory is that because React looks at object identity to determine when to
re-render memoized components, and when to re-run hooks, a `useRef`-style
solution isn't good enough. Given that `Proxy` is required for other hooks to
not misbehave, maybe they weren't interested in requiring `Proxy` to use
`useState`, since `Proxy` can't be polyfilled for Internet Explorer. Perhaps
they just thought this approach wasn't worth the complication. Maybe they didn't
consider it? I don't know.

## Conclusion

Many blog posts document the difficulty of working with closures in React hooks,
but I haven't seen any that mention how we can make new hooks to deal with the
issue. Don't forget that you can always make new hooks to help you solve
problems.

## Addendum

[Preact signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) look like an even
better solution to the problem. I like Preact anyway for a lot of reasons.
