  Review: DELTARUNE Chapter 3
description: >-
  Toby Fox and friends really outdid themselves with this one.

Due to various reasons, I restarted from Chapter 1 before playing this. It's
incredible seeing the evolution of Deltarune across these three chapters.
Chapter 3 especially has _so much_ gameplay that's wholly different from the
previous chapters (and Undertale)... and it feels **great**!

Mr. "Ant" Tenna is simply incredible. I've always loved how expressive
characters are in these games, with different sprites indicating their emotions,
and unique "beep beeps" for their dialogue, giving each character a "voice"
while retaining the feel of a text-driven game. Tenna, though? Holy _shit_ they
went all out. His giant Donkey Kong Country-esque pre-rendered 3D ass in the
middle of Chapter 3 feels incongruent and perfect.

Most of the chapter involves you playing on Tenna's game show, and it was just
really freaking fun! I loved the game-within-a-game concept for keeping things
fresh, and I had fun with the entire thing.

The writing is once again fun, funny, serious, and sad. Despite the episodic
nature of Deltarune, this one did a good job of progressing the overarching
story about the Roaring Knight and the connection between the Light World and
Dark World. I even teared up a little bit at one part.
