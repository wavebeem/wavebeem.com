  "I tried 24 different jams and spreads in the days leading up to Christmas."

This was my first year doing the [Bonne Maman](https://bonnemaman.us) advent
calendar, and I'm so glad I did. I got another copy for my family, and we texted
every day to chat about the flavors.

In order to be consistent, I ate every spread on a single piece of Dave's Killer
Bread "White Bread Done Right" toast (I gave the other piece to Ash). Some of
these spreads would definitely be better suited to crackers or ice cream (or
just straight from the jar to your mouth), if I wanted to maximize enjoyment,
though.

1. **Wild blueberry Maple**

   Tangy and sweet. Reminded me of [IHOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHOP),
   but in a good way.

2. **Fig Cardamom**

   Warm and subtle. Both flavors were understated.

3. **Plum Pear Star Anise**

   Plum forward. Feels complex. The other flavors are hard to uniquely identify,
   but definitely add something! This time I remembered to lick the spoon.
   Enticing when consumed directly.

4. **Cherry Violet Leaves**

   I'm not super familiar with Violet as a flavor, but I can tell something is
   happening besides Cherry. The cherry flavor is rich and mouthwatering.

5. **Apple Caramel Cinnamon**

   I can taste everything!! It's so good. Like apple pie meets jam. Different
   consistency than apple butter.

6. **Apricot Lavender**

   Wow. Tastes distinctly of both things. Super flavorful. Good pairing.

7. **Caramel Coffee Spread**

   Absolutely divine. Sweet and bitter. Never had anything like this before.

8. **White Nectarine Peach Lemon Verbena**

   A bit tart. Fresh and fruity. I liked it! Perhaps a lot of things going on
   here, but it does come out nice.

9. **Madagascar Vanilla Caramel**

   An absolute banger. A rich vanilla flavor elevates this creamy caramel.

10. **Wild Blueberry Lychee Rose**

    The lychee is the focal point here for me and really ties it together. I've
    never had lychee jam. Yummy!

11. **Pineapple Rum Vanilla**

    Tastes like everything on the label! A bit weird as a jam. Makes me want a
    tropical cocktail or a pineapple upside down cake.

12. **Redcurrant Raspberry**

    Bright, tart, and flavorful!

13. **Apricot Honey**

    Tastes as described. Particularly appealing directly off the spoon. Still
    good on the toast. Very strong on the honey.

14. **Mango Ginger**

    Pungent! Almost more ginger than mango. I like it (I like ginger candy, for
    context), but I'd prefer a little more mango flavor.

15. **Orange Guava Lime**

    Yum! I love this one. I would love this so much of it was a soda. Perfect
    flavor combo. Surprising as a jam though. Very flavorful. The guava is
    really enticing.

16. **Orange Yuzu Grapefruit**

    Tangy! Quite a bit for a jam. A bit weird on toast, but good flavor.

17. **Pear Mandarin Cinnamon**

    The cinnamon feels lost, but otherwise I enjoy this. Mandarin is the primary
    flavor for sure, but it's tempered.

18. **Cherry Pink Peppercorn**

    Nice cherry flavor. Pepper is subtle and hits the tongue later. Well
    balanced.

19. **Mandarin**

    More bitter than I expected. Not bad, though.

20. **Peach Blackcurrant Sichuan Pepper**

    I'm sadly not getting the Sichuan pepper. Otherwise it's a tasty jam.

21. **Strawberry Passion Fruit**

    The strawberry flavor was great. I couldn't identify the passion fruit by
    name, but a 2nd flavor was obviously contributing in a fun way.

22. **Raspberry Lychee**

    A solid, balanced pairing. I thought it was a nice improvement on raspberry
    jam, which I've grown slightly less fond of recently.

23. **Rhubarb Strawberry**

    I could eat this whole jar with a spoon. Good on toast too though. Yum.

24. **Caramel Salted Butter**

    Absolutely incredible. A decadent finale.

I painstakingly kept and cleaned all 24 jars. I don't know what I'll do with
them yet ([Bonne Maman has ideas though](https://bonnemaman.us/blogs/diy)), but
they are so adorable.

By the way, did you know that
_[Bonne](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bonne#French)
[Maman](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maman#French)_ means "good mom" in
French?
