## PP Talisman

My new "heading" font, or "cool" font as I'm calling it in the code, is
[PP Talisman](https://pangrampangram.com/products/talisman). It feels like it
could be a sibling of
[Ultra Hi-Gloss](https://itemlabel.com/products/ultra-hi-gloss-font) (my logo
font).

As much as I love [PP Agrandir](https://pangrampangram.com/products/agrandir),
it wasn't different enough from my body text.

## I needed more quirkiness

I realized that the quirky flavor of my page felt a little bit lost during my
longer blog posts. I don't want to change those, so I figured I needed to lean
in harder with a funky font!

## "Blog" page

I decided to make my `<h3>` tags bold and italic just to shake things up a bit.
Given that the `<h2>` and `<h3>` aren't that different in font size, I wanted
them to be easier to tell apart from each other.

I specifically decided **not** to use my "cool" font for `<h3>` because the page
felt "over-seasoned" with that much quirky font back to back lol.

## "Infobox"

Not exactly a font thing, but the colored background for my "infoboxes" has been
bothering me for a while. I love the color for my footer, but it feels out of
place in the middle of the page. Also, it's a color that decreases the contrast
of the foreground, which I'm not in love with. I like dotted borders a lot, and
this felt like a really natural place to use them again.

## "Projects" page

The repeated bold headers with the same font felt completely overwhelming no
this page. Switching up the `<h3>` font and using _italic_ text (well,
_oblique_, really), helped break up the monotony.

## "Things I use" page

The repetitive headers felt the worst on this page since almost everything was
using my "cool" font (_PP Agrandir_, at the time), which was making it feel
boring instead.

Apparently the `<summary>` element is seen as a button by default to assistive
technologies, so the `<h3>` tags were being downgraded to plain text anyways...
so for this one I just changed to using the `<i>` tag.

## I'm having fun

And what's what matters. I hope you like the new font and other design tweaks
too :) Let me know what you think.
