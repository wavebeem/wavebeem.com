  Very verdant: Even more green
description: >-
  After starting Firefox and VS Code themes, I realized my website didn't have
  enough green. I massively improved dark mode, and added more green everywhere.
  Enjoy the screenshots.

## Before and after

The champagne color just wasn't working for me any more. Green is my color and I
didn't have enough of it on the page. I broke free from my "no borders"
approach, leaning on colorful green borders to lend some fun to the light mode,
without making the backgrounds awkward.

Dark mode looked... bad before. I should've remembered one of my old designs had
a nice dark, desaturated green background. Going green with the text didn't
really look good on the gray background, but white text on the dark green looks
great, I think. If you like green websites, definitely check out

## Page middle

There is so much champagne on screen! It's cute, but it's _not me_. Bring the
green!

The dark gray is certainly less divisive than champagne, but it doesn't have any
of my style _at all_. Infusing the page with a dark green background made me
really like the dark theme again.

## Page bottom

This was the worst spot for me. Green is drowned out by so many other colors.
It's all green now! Also, I think the borders make the areas of interest a bit
more obvious on the page anyways.

## The new font

I posted about this on social media, but I discovered
[Montserrate Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates)
shortly after announcing my rebrand. Its incredibly round letters fit my new
circular style well. I enjoy that the uppercase letters look a lot like
lowercase letters, which gives it a friendly vibe.

## What's next?

My Firefox theme is nearly complete, though I never release those publicly
anyway. I'm using my new Visual Studio Code theme _right now_, and plan to
release that in the coming weeks. The fresh green is making me smile right now.
