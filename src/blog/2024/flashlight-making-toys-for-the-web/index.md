  following the cursor. It looks somewhat convincingly like a flashlight. Enjoy!"

## Introducing: Flashlight

I recently created [netpet](https://netpet.wavebeem.com/), a Tamagotchi-like
virtual pet. I realized that one of my favorite things to do is making a small
web application that doesn't have any real value besides a small amount of
entertainment.

Today I made a flashlight you can toggle on this page.

## Why I wanted to learn programming

When I was young, I dreamed of being a video game developer. The famous
[EA Spouse](https://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html) story was published when
I was 14 years old. This drastically changed my interest in entering the video
game field. I was already learning how to program at the time, though, and the
story didn't suppress my interest in programming. Four years later I was getting
my B.A. in Computer Science. I had dabbled in "web development" already by
making static HTML & CSS websites, but in 2011 I started learning JS.

## The tech industry

At this point I've spent over a decade working as a software developer. In the
early days, I was still voraciously consuming tutorials, blog posts, and
especially official documentation for anything remotely related to my interests
and skill sets. I was doing lots of open source work in my free time.

Nowadays I don't really do that kind of stuff as much. I don't think the web
platform has slowed down exactly, but maybe there's less "game changer" type
things coming out, and it feels like many of my colleagues are even further
behind on new web standards and features than I am.

## Embracing the platform

I feel like I've become out of touch with the web platform. I've spent the last
six years working with [React](https://react.dev/), and I've grown increasingly
frustrated with it. React has started to show its age, with other frameworks
flawlessly supporting
[custom elements](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), out of the box
styling abstractions, routing, faster runtimes, and smaller file sizes. And
don't even get me started on
[hooks and useState](/blog/2022/why-i-dont-like-usestate/).

I've made a goal for myself to learn more about the web platform. The pace of
improvement to core web APIs and features is incredible. The level of code you
can ship with zero libraries and compilers is better than it's ever been. And
despite the haters, custom elements are pretty good.

## Wrapping up

You can expect to see more small toys for the web from me in the future. It
feels like a good way to keep my skills sharp, and I have a lot of fun making
them.
