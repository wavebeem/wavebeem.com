## Ingredients

- 1 block of firm tofu
- Corn starch
- Oil
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Garlic powder
- Mayonnaise
- Nutritional yeast

## Preparation

Drain the tofu. Ideally you'd have a tool for this, but a pan and a towel can
work in a pinch.

Preheat the oven to 450 °F (230 °C).

Cut tofu into thick slices. One block of tofu should make about 6 or 8 crispy
tofu strips.

Toss the tofu in a bowl with oil, corn starch, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
You want just enough oil for the dry ingredients to stick. A little corn starch
goes a long way. You don't want the tofu to be solid white. Just a very thin
layer.

Bake on a sheet pan for about 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool.

Toss the tofu strips to coat in a small amount of mayonnaise. A thin coating
works best. Pour a generous amount of nutritional yeast on the tofu. Toss to
combine. Let sit briefly. Eat.

## Notes

Store leftovers in the refrigerator. They reheat well in an oven or toaster
oven. In fact, the mayonnaise and nutritional yeast coating becomes more
cohesive with time. Sometimes these are better the next day.

If you want buffalo tofu, you can make a simple buffalo sauce by melting butter
and combining with hot sauce. You can toss or dip your tofu strips in it.
