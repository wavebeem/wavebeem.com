This is my favorite simple dip/spread to make at home. Most premade dips are not
suitable for me due to my
[IBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome). This dip doesn't
contain onions, garlic, beans, or
[_Brassica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica) plants.

## Ingredients

- Tub of labneh (or Greek yogurt, or sour cream)
- Za'atar seasoning (a lot)
- Ground sumac powder (a lot)
- Salt (to taste)
- Black pepper (to taste)
- Vinegar (just a tiny bit)
- Olive oil (to taste/texture)

## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients in order.

2. Eat it.

## Tips

This is good as a spread on sandwiches, as a dip for flatbread (pita, naan,
tortillas), or eaten straight with a spoon :P.

If you like cheese, you can substitute the salt and vinegar with feta chese. You
should buy feta that comes in brine (this is the best kind) and also pour some
of the brine in to the mix. You may also want less olive oil if you do that,
since it will make the dip runnier.
